A simple widget that enumerates the list of users you're following or the users that are following you

== Description ==

[Tweeps4WP](http://wp.anoop.net/tweeps4wp/ "Tweeps4WP Home") is a WordPress widget that displays the latest list of followers or friends for your twitter account

Tweeps4WP requires PHP 5.0 or newer.

Tweeps4WP requires curl as well. it will not work without curl.

Tweeps4WP requires SimpleXML as well

For it to work, you need a twitter account and must store your password in the
database. Once stored, it is never revealed anywhere and only used when making
the calls to twitter's api.

The XML returned from twitter is stored in a database for a period of time.
Minimum 10 minutes. If expired, it will automatically refresh itself.
This is in place so that the twitter servers are not overwhelmed for any
reason. Also, because you can easily lock your account out or something if you
violate the quotas.

== Changelog ==

= 0.0.4 =
mini images from twitter aren't always mini. They're called mini but sometimes they're normal. This update ensures that all images are resized to 24x24 just like twitter.com does.

= 0.0.3 =
* Having an incorrect password produces all sorts of nasty errors. Made these errors go away and simply display a message stating that the list is not available at this time. 

= 0.0.2 =
* fixed justification issues and tested in Firefox, IE7, Safari, and Opera
